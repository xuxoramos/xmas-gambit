6. Wrap each box in gift-wrapping paper
7. Form 2 teams of equal number of players. One will be read team, the other will be the blue team.
9. Gather each team around each of the tables
10. Select an initial player for each team
   - This player will attempt to open the gift box...
   - ...while the player to the left throws the 2 4-sided dice.
12. Place each of the gift boxes in each of the tables
13. Place 2 4-sided dice in each of the tables
14. Place 2 oven mitts in each of the tables
15. Place the blue cards on the blue team's table, and the red cards on the red team's table
16. Place face masks on every player at each table
17. Say "TRANSMAT FIRING" loudly to start the game


## Game algorithm

1. As described in 3.10, the player selected to be the first to attempt to break open the gift box will put on the oven mitts and try to pry it open.
2. Meanwhile, the player to the left will throw the dice, observing the following results:
   - **2 identical rolls:** the roles of the player who is attempting to open the box and the one that threw the dice shifts to the left, so that the player who threw the dice is now attempting to break open the box, while the player to the left is now throwing dice.
   - **Roll a 12:** The GM will take a 1-hand blocker card of that player's table and slam it on the opposing team's table. The player of this opposing table who is attempting to open the box can now use only 1 hand for the remainder of the turn.
      - Alternatively, the player who rolled the 12 can "save" this blocker for later.
   - **Perfect 2 (1/1)**: The GM will take a blind blocker card of that player's table and slam it on the opposing team's table. The player of this opposing table who is attempting to open the box must now put the face mask over their eyes to impair vision for the remainder of the turn.
      - Alternatively, the player who rolled the 12 can "save" this blocker for later.
3. **Invasion**: when the 2 blocker cards have been saved, the team that saved them can invade. Invasion is as follows:
   - The GM will yell _"YOU'RE BEING INVADED"_ and slam the 2 cards on the other team's table.
   - The invading player will place themselves to the left of the player who is unwrapping the gift box, so that when their turn comes and the 2 identicals are rolled, the gift box will fall into the invading player's hands.
   - The invader takes control of the gift box and starts rolling heavy duty scotch tape around it with one of these dispensers: https://es.uline.mx/Product/Detail/H-464O/Hand-Held-Tape-Dispensers/Uline-Heavy-Duty-Tape-Dispenser-2-Orange?pricode=WB7059&gadtype=pla&id=H-464O&gclid=Cj0KCQiAnuGNBhCPARIsACbnLzr6_UNEnkg2ysQDjWa39iUnE7KjtrLBUbkObFLNkTg73RL3h66imwEaArcMEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
   - The invasion lasts until 2 identicals are rolled, as per normal game rules. The invader returns to their original table.
   - The invaded table returns to normal game described in 2.
4. The team that manages to unwrap the gift inside all the boxes wins.
